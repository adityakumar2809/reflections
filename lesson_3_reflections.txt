  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would make my repository remote when I want more than one contributor for my 
    project or when i want to reach my repository from various systems.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In case a user is working on some file of a project and some other user upadates the same file in the remote, then in case of automatically pulling the files the file being currently worked upon will get overwritten and the changes made by former user will vanish if have not been saved and hence it is more beneficial to have manual pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork enables us to copy a repository from one account to another on the server of GitHub itself.
    Clone enable us to create a copy of a repository into local machine
    Branching help us to create a parallel running copy of the same code in the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It helps in tracking which commits must be pushed or from where it must be pulled.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would have to send an receive e mails for any changes i have made or any another of my colaborators have made and will have to update all my files accordingly.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making any experimental changes or while working in collaboration we need to work on other branches rather than master branch only.
